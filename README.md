### </> Filter Method

### </> Description: </br>

filter() calls a provided callbackFn function once for each element in an array, and constructs a new array of all the values for which callbackFn returns a value that coerces to true. callbackFn is invoked only for indexes of the array which have assigned values; it is not invoked for indexes which have been deleted or which have never been assigned values. Array elements which do not pass the callbackFn test are skipped, and are not included in the new array.
